Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a gem? 

Your answer: I believe gem is an extension how json is to Javscript. It's adds files needed for Ruby to run. 

Researched answer: A gem is a library that allows functionality without having to create code. It is also a plug in for adding features, also not requiring coding. Ruby and Ruby on Rails is very friendly in this manner as it wants to help out as much as possible. 

2. What does the acronym CRUD stand for?

Your answer: The acronym CRUD stand's for create, read, update, and delete. I was also taught that those are used for HTTP request such as a get request is to read. We also use this a lot in Ruby on Rails. 

Researched answer: CRUD is a way a developer can access stored data. It is also only used for backend development. 

3. What is Ruby on Rails?

Your answer: Ruby on Rails is a framework of the programming language Ruby. It is the back end side of developement as it is a server side web application framework that is open sourced. 

Researched answer: Ruby on Rails is the full stack to create a web application also utilizing Ruby. Ruby on Rails is an MVC a model, view, and controller framework. 

4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: That is a great question and at this time, I'm not remembering what a relational database is, but I do know that there is another kind of database opposite of relational. Let me get back to you with that answer. 

Researched answer: A relational database is something recognizable in the sense we would use tables, columns, and rows to show data to someone (pgAdmin4). The other kind of database would be non-relational and that means one is stored using tables while the other is non-tabular form and that means not using the traditional relational database management systems. 

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer: Primary keys are unique identifiers. They are important, because we can pull information based on that key. However, when a primary key is deleted, that identifier is gone for forever. Let's say you delete 2, your program will show 1, 3, 4, 5 etc. 2 will never be there again. It is important to ensure quality when assiging information as we can update, but if we have to delete just know it will be gone for forever. 

Researched answer: A unique identifier in a relational database that is used for holding records like a file cabinet. The primary key is the identifier for the whole column. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: Is a route that helps the HTTP request verbs meet an action (CRUD).

2. JSON: JavaScript Object Notation which is a lightweight transmitter of data, such as sending data to someone and they open it on their labtop to view it. 

3. ERB: Embedded Ruby, and it contains a source code used as a Ruby templating language. It essentially is taking Ruby and putting it into a text document. (Is it similar to linking HTML and CSS or HTML to JS?)

4. Params: It seems to be an important keyword in C# which means parameter?

5. API: Application programming interface is the connection between applications and the software being used.
